So this will be my first entry into the code blog. Firstly, thanks for checking out my site! Secondly, thanks for taking an interest in my thought process behind it! I'm generally very busy with work, my daughter (I do the majority of cooking for my household, and we don't use any pre-made meals at home, so this takes a significant amount of time), and trying to learn to code well enough to switch jobs, so I don't always have someone to talk to about coding or my though process. I do understand the importance of talking, though, and its ability to help work through issues or clarify reasoning, even without feedback; so you, if you are indeed you and not an uncaring void, will be my [rubber duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging).

I'll probably write more in the future about specific design decisions as well as future plans for the site if for no other reason than to force myself to explain it to someone else, however hypothetical they may be. For now, however, I wanted to talk about the custom script I will be using for these blog posts.

I will eventually find a better way to use the script, but for now it resides in the base folder of my website. It creates a file using the current year, month, day, hour, minute, and second as the filename, separated by an underscore, mostly in order to make sure I don't step on my own toes while trying to choose a name for my blog post and accidentally overwrite an older post. I chose that order so that they will truly be in chronological order within the folder, with the most recent at the bottom (I've accepted seconds as a resonable limitation for myself, since while I may some day create more than one post in the same minute, if I create more than one post in the same second it was likely an accident, otherwise it was an impulsive flight of desparation which is better off overwritten). 

So the file is created in the first-level subdirectory "blog" which will be created if nonexistent. The file is pre-populated with standard markdown heading; the script will accept the first argument as the blogpost title, otherwise it will generate with the filename as the title. The file is then opened immediately for editing in vim. And that's it, really. I might include something after the file is saved which will automatically convert the markdown file to html with pandoc, but I think that may be better left for when the files are more or less finished, since I am a profligate draft writer.

I wrote this originally when I was playing with the idea of writing a small static site generator for my own use, which is an idea I still am considering for this site, but due to my desire to pursue a career in code in the near future, visibility is probably the most important. I know at this point I've probably said "thank you" more than a Canadian says "sorry" but, sincerely, thank you for taking the time to read this. I have never really interacted on social media, so the prospect of real people reading anything that I write in an intimate setting gives me whatever the internet analogue of stage fright is, and it's a lot of effort for me to avoid over-editing in order to give an authentic and hopefully not unflattering picture of myself.
