    <p class="title">Tiny steps forward</p>
    <p>I have been making some slight progress trying to ramp up my
    coding routine once again. It started with me tweaking the color
    palette because I did have kind of a weird one based off of a
    picture of a small green berry plant in a clay vase next to an
    orange and white striped ceramic cup which were used as a
    placesetting in a Japanese restaurant with very brown wood. I set up
    a small <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server">http
    server</a> so I could fix my links and my wife made a comment about
    it within a second of viewing it; I have since switched to <a
    href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server">Nord</a>.</p>
    <p>Right now, I am moving the script I have for building my site
    into a separate folder so that it could be used on any directory,
    and since it isn’t in the parent directory makes it easier to push
    to production. I’m also tweaking the structure a little bit to keep
    the directories cleaner, which includes keeping all markdown and
    converted pages in the “blog” directory (which was what I had done
    originally but I had the idea that if the site it would be used for
    would be a blog, it would be redundant), moving the partials to
    their own folder in ./assets, and tweaking the css files to make
    sure all universal style items are outside of the media queries. I
    have done a bit of writing, or at least started on some ideas, and
    tweaked my system a little bit (including installing <a
    href="https://newsboat.org/">newsboat</a>, <a
    href="https://github.com/gokcehan/lf">lf</a>, and migrating over to
    <a href="https://mpv.io/installation/">mpv</a> from vlc, hopefully
    permanently).</p>
    <p>I’m about to be on my way to teach some friends how to make some
    sicilian pizza, so I have to keep this quite short, but I think
    externalizing my progress a little bit can help to keep me focuse
    later by bringing things up I may take for granted when working.</p>
