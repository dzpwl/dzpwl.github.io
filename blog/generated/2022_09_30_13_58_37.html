    <p class="title">Learning curves with pandoc</p>
    <p>I’m starting this post as mostly a method of venting, since I
    have spent the better part of my work over the last couple of days
    struggling with the documentation of <a
    href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a> (I should note the fault is
    likely my own).</p>
    <p>This originally started when I had been unable to get my partials
    to display when converting my markdown entries using my template. I
    had been following all of the styles shown on pandoc’s
    documentation, from <code>${nav()}</code> to <code>${ nav() }</code>
    to <code>${ nav() }$</code> to <code>${ nav.tpl() }$</code> and
    nothing had worked. I can chalk that up to the pandoc that is in <a
    href="https://trisquel.info">trisquel’s</a> repositories (nothing
    against the folks at trisquel, I understand how difficult distro
    management can be when your goal is to remove all proprietary code
    from another distro whose team is much larger). So I did install the
    most recent version of pandoc which did resolve this portion of
    it.</p>
    <p>The next part is one that I didn’t quite understand when I had
    read it. Specifically, this part:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Templates contain variables, which allow for the inclusion of
    arbitrary information at any point in the file. They may be set at
    the command line using the -V/–variable option. If a variable is not
    set, pandoc will look for the key in the document’s metadata, which
    can be set using either YAML metadata blocks or with the
    -M/–metadata option.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I could’t quite tell from the wording, but I had taken this to
    mean that you could just set an empty set for the partial’s variable
    (in my case, <code>sidebar</code>). In actuality, it seems that you
    can set any variable you want in the metadata, whether or not you
    reference that data at all. Originally, I left the set empty, which
    did not work, so I yanked and pasted a line from the
    <code>"nav"</code> section to test, and my placeholder text showed
    up! After making my intentions more explicit:</p>
    <div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
    class="sourceCode json"><code class="sourceCode json"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">{</span></span>

    <p>Forgive the awful URLs as I do a lot of testing offline, and I do
    fix these before uploading. I just like navigating around to get a
    feel for the site.</p>
    <p>Anyway, it was definitely a frustrating bit of time trying to
    come to grips with this, and as impatient as I can get due to how
    little time I do actually get to sit down and code, it’s a great
    lesson to be petient with the proper documentation. As much
    websearching as I did to find the problem, this specific one did not
    show up at all, whether due to nobody else trying to do exactly what
    I was doing, or my inability to <a

    <p><a
    href="https://rsdoiel.github.io/blog/2020/11/09/Pandoc-Partials.html">This</a>
    was a great resource when tackling this problem, and was the reason
    I realized what I was initially doing wrong when failing to specify
    the metadata file, which greatly reduced my time to actually fix the
    issue. So, thanks!</p>
    <p>And thanks again to you for reading about my short-sighted
    misadventures.</p>
