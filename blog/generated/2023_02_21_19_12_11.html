    <p class="title">Recovery and two lessons</p>
    <p>Well, it has been a long time and I’m just going to jump right
    into it without my normal lengthy setup.</p>
    <p>In January, I had to have a last-minute gall bladder removal
    (cholocystectomy). I started in with a pain while on a quick
    overnight trip to Leavenworth to give my daughter at least one last
    day of playing in the snow. I woke up at 2am Friday morning with
    what felt like a really bad case of heartburn which slightly
    improved by being upright. After driving home from Leavenworth, two
    trips to separate urgent care clinics, and a specialist visit, it
    was determined I need to have my gall bladder out. Although my case
    was urgent and needed addressing, it wasn’t immediately
    life-threatening which meant I could have a cheaper elective surgery
    in a facility in Kirkland. So, after a full week of constant pain,
    it was finally over, replaced by a much more temporary pain which I
    only needed to wait to pass.</p>
    <p>So that’s what I’ve been the majority of 2023: unable to lift a
    2.5 year old and dropping to my knees every time I have to cough or
    sneeze. Now onto the two things I learned the hard way over the last
    day.</p>
    <p>So I have some scripts for a conky panel which features some
    information about the computer I’m currently using, augmented with
    some information about my current imprecise location as well as the
    weather. I had switched from using <a
    href="openweathermap.com">openweathermap.com</a> to <a
    href="wttr.in">wttr.in</a> for my weather info and wrapped it all up
    in a <a
    href="https://github.com/dzpwl/doot/blob/laptop/.config/scripts/weather_updated">script</a>
    since my weather info is separated into one bit of info per line to
    reduce the amount of curl commands I would use. Well at some point
    yesterday, wttr had broken, appearing to have surpassed a monthly
    limit of queries. In the script, I had never assumed that the
    service at wttr might not always work, so when it broke, it broke in
    a very <a
    href="https://reddit.com/r/softwaregore">r/softwaregore</a> kind of
    way. All of the anticipated fields were still displayed, and instead
    of having a delimiter-separated string of data, I was given an
    unsightly error which was being displayed spectacularly in my
    temperature line, with all the following pieces of information
    conspicuously blank.</p>
    <p>So I made two changes to the script, with my new appreciation for
    error-handling design; firstly, check the status code of the service
    I would like to query; and secondly, which was particular to the
    issue with wttr, if it returns a <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/200">200
    OK</a>, figure out whether or not there is still an issue.</p>
    <p>I would obviously have to have a plan for what would happen in
    these eventualities (since yes, they will rarely but assuredly be
    unreachable at some point). The first was done easily with, aside
    from function declaration and closing bracket, a single line of
    code. The second was a bit trickier, and at the moment of publishing
    of this post the script on my github is not the final code. What I
    had initially done was rely on another expected behavior; in this
    instance, the fact that an issue with wttr’s service while still
    showing a 200 OK on a status check will return a string beginning
    with “Unknown”. After the quick fix, it dawned on me that this was
    the same thing I had been doing in the first place, just wearing a
    bit of a different hat. So the final fix to this version of the
    script will check that the information I am expecting is in the
    expected format; anything else will result in the script essentially
    noping out and returning nothing. In the case of my conky panel, It
    certainly looks better to have no weather info at all rather than a
    bunch of unpopulated fields.</p>
    <p>The second lesson, which I learned this morning came as a great
    opportunity to learn a little bit more about git. I had notice on my
    laptop that for some reason my <a
    href="https://github.com/dzpwl/doot">dotfile repository</a> was
    missing the branch I had created for my desktop. In the process of
    trying to pull (slight foreshadowing) a copy onto my laptop, I made
    the mistake of using <code>git pull</code> instead of
    <code>git fetch</code> and accidentally merged most of my files. I
    was able to revert all of the changes mostly painlessly, as after
    fetching the branch I could just <code>git checkout</code> all of
    the files I wanted updated anyway, and what was left was just what
    should be local copies of files. I’ve mostly gone through to remove
    any files I would reasonably assume to be tinkered with (namely,
    <code>.bashrc</code>, <code>.jwmrc</code>, and
    <code>alacritty.yml</code>) which makes it easier to switch between
    branches anyway since I don’t get all the warnings about having
    different copies of the same file that are going to be replaced when
    using <code>git checkout {branch}</code>.</p>
    <p>Anyway, it was certainly an insightful 24 hours, and I’m
    certainly better for having gone through these issues firsthand
    since now I can have these things in my mind from the beginning when
    I start to write. I hope this wasn’t too much to read, and thanks
    for sticking with me if you’ve made it this far. It’s a blog about
    newbie hobbyist coding problems anyway, it’s not exactly the most
    riveting material.</p>
