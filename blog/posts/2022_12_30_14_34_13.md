I have been making some slight progress trying to ramp up my coding routine once again. It started with me tweaking the color palette because I did have kind of a weird one based off of a picture of a small green berry plant in a clay vase next to an orange and white striped ceramic cup which were used as a placesetting in a Japanese restaurant with very brown wood. I set up a small [http server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) so I could fix my links and my wife made a comment about it within a second of viewing it; I have since switched to [Nord](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).

Right now, I am moving the script I have for building my site into a separate folder so that it could be used on any directory, and since it isn't in the parent directory makes it easier to push to production. I'm also tweaking the structure a little bit to keep the directories cleaner, which includes keeping all markdown and converted pages in the "blog" directory (which was what I had done originally but I had the idea that if the site it would be used for would be a blog, it would be redundant), moving the partials to their own folder in ./assets, and tweaking the css files to make sure all universal style items are outside of the media queries. I have done a bit of writing, or at least started on some ideas, and tweaked my system a little bit (including installing [newsboat](https://newsboat.org/), [lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf), and migrating over to [mpv](https://mpv.io/installation/) from vlc, hopefully permanently). 

I'm about to be on my way to teach some friends how to make some sicilian pizza, so I have to keep this quite short, but I think externalizing my progress a little bit can help to keep me focuse later by bringing things up I may take for granted when working.
