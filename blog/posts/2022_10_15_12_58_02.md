I have been trudging along a bit with some coding lately, as I find myself busier than I'd like to be, again. I have been poking around the website a little bit, improving the appearance on mobile. I know I should have started with mobile first, but I have been relying on the inspector built in to Firefox (or in my specific case, [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net), and it just doesn't look exactly like it does on mobile. However, I do have all the media queries in place for each of the standard devices referenced in [this handy post on CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/); I have adapted the values here to cover those within a reasonable range of each other in order to not have 20 different sets of media queries with more or less the same rules.

Beyond that, I have updated my [dotfile repository](https://github.com/dzpwl/doot) to include branches for my laptop and my different desktops (I primarily use [fedora](https://getfedora.org) and [trisquel](https://trisquel.info/) with [jwm](https://joewing.net/projects/jwm/) as my wm). It's been a great learning experience for git and how that works, how the branches relate to each other, how they should be used (after this experience, I would not use separate branches to target different devices for any project I'd expect any other human to use). In this process, I found that the menu generator that I use on trisquel, crispy waffle, is no longer available. [antiX](https://antixlinux.com/), which I use on my laptop, has its own menu generator that would work just fine  (based off of [this one](http://xdg-menu.sourceforge.net/)), but I decided what the heck, why not try out the experience of writing my own.

Currently, it is written in bash, and is not exactly POSIX compliant, but when writing it, I found that bash is definitely not the tool best suited for it. Both xdg-menu and antiX's desktop-menu tools are written in python, probably not just because the latter is based off of the former, but because it is a better-suited tool for the job.
