      <p>Here is where I write about what I have been doing lately in
      detail, with some justifications for some of the choices I’ve been
      making, and the occasional “personal” entry where I will most
      likely opine about how my coding experience is going and maybe how
      I think it should be going.</p>

      <h3 id="why-the-name">Why the name?</h3>
      <p>The ACME corporation was the company which created the
      disatrous products in the Roadrunner/Wile E. Coyote cartoons.
      Whether it was true or just my perception, the name had by the 90s
      taken on a connotation of something generic and unspectacular
      rather than dangerous. During my long, distraction-laden journey
      into code, I found an attraction to communities and people with a
      focus on simplicity and a disdain for flashiness (particularly <a
      href="https://stallman.org/">Richard Stallman</a> and the <a
      href="https://suckless.org/">suckless community</a>), ideals which
      I hope to make the focus of my programming output. “Acme” is a
      playful reference to the association one can have when interacting
      with an unassuming program that is presented without frills, and
      “church” refers to the tendency for this style of programmer to
      come off as “preachy” (and my personal ability to turn a simple
      answer into a sermon).</p>
