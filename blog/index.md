# The Church of Acme Code Blog #

::: {#intro}
Here is where I write about what I have been doing lately in detail, with some justifications for some of the choices I've been making, and the occasional "personal" entry where I will most likely opine about how my coding experience is going and maybe how I think it should be going.

### Why the name? ###

The ACME corporation was the company which created the disatrous products in the Roadrunner/Wile E. Coyote cartoons. Whether it was true or just my perception, the name had by the 90s taken on a connotation of something generic and unspectacular rather than dangerous. During my long, distraction-laden journey into code, I found an attraction to communities and people with a focus on simplicity and a disdain for flashiness (particularly [Richard Stallman](https://stallman.org/) and the [suckless community](https://suckless.org/)), ideals which I hope to make the focus of my programming output. "Acme" is a playful reference to the association one can have when interacting with an unassuming program that is presented without frills, and "church" refers to the tendency for this style of programmer to come off as "preachy" (and my personal ability to turn a simple answer into a sermon).
