index.md in a project folder will be a blog-style explanation of the code.

It should begin with a brief summary in the format of project name, technologies used, and a link to view the project live (if it is web-based, which at this moment they all should be)

There should be an explanation of the code and how it works that a beginner could understand, as well as any defense of code choices where there could be a reasonable argument to do it a different way. If I'm not entirely sure about what that entails, just keep it in mind, but the example I can think of now would be whether printf vs echo or [ vs [[ in bash.
