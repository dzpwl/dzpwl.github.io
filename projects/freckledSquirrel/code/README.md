Notes:

Adjust the title box to the center of the div
Fix sidebar color
Make the sidebar collapsible
Tidy up the google maps widget
Create the menus
Create the private events section
Create the about section

Put more effort into making the site a bit more interactive and a bit more polished. Ideas: scrolling photos, animated landing page, or a jumbotron of the squirrel logo in large that shrinks and moves to its position at the top of the sidebar as you scroll down.

Have the menus pop into view in the div as you click on them (i HATE .pdf menus)
